England secured place Russia 1-0 victory Slovenia Wembley Thursday, struggling, spluttering performance underlined scale task facing Southgate end almost unbroken tale under-achievement recent major tournaments. Fabio Capello's England thrashed 4-1 Germany last 16 World Cup South Africa 2010 successor, Roy Hodgson, could get England group stage Brazil four years later.

There little fanfare, celebration sense expectation around discontented Wembley England limped finishing line Thursday - evidence Southgate huge job get squad shape next summer. So big issues facing 47-year-old Southgate, officially placed charge November 2016 Allardyce's 67-day reign, plans end England's cycle failure? Stick Hart goal? Joe Hart fault one Iceland's goals Euro 2016 Joe Hart unchallenged England's first-choice tournament keeper since Euro 2012 Poland Ukraine, 30-year-old facing twin obstacles declining form increased competition. Hart made crucial errors technical flaws exposed conceding long-range goals Gareth Bale Wales Iceland's decisive goal Kolbeinn Sigthorsson - low left distance - Euro 2016 endured mixed spell loan Torino Pep Guardiola decided man Manchester City. Now West Ham, Hart came scrutiny conceding free-kicks Leigh Griffiths 2-2 draw Scotland Hampden Park June. Southgate surprised many staunch faith Hart, made international debut June 2008, retaining qualifiers Malta home Slovakia, although made important double save Harry Kane's late winner Slovenia Wembley Thursday. However, return form fitness Stoke's Jack Butland - year injuring ankle playing England Germany - means goalkeeping debate continue. With Jordan Pickford, 23, rare shaft light Everton's desperate start season Â£30m move Sunderland, debate likely pored weekly basis England keep faith Hart also best back-up options enjoyed years. Southgate may taking history lesson comes England changing keepers failed introduction Scott Carson key Euro 2008 qualifier home Croatia Rob Green's blunder gave United States draw opening game 2010 World Cup.

Pickford got lot plate establish full season Everton. He's moved big price tag. ""Butland 24 long time injury last year. It big season terms fitness. Can play full season? Has got durability?"" Waddle says: ""Joe driving seat unless makes couple big mistakes. ""There certain positions team need settled partnerships. You need goalkeeper know back four well centre-halves. It problem throwing people tournament."" Former England defender Terry Butcher, believes time change, says: ""If got someone Jack Butland's presence behind gives even confidence, Joe mistakes. ""Joe done well England time come end now."" Southgate's instincts, least, tell stick Hart. Can centre defence take strain? In 12 matches since Euro 2016 England started six different centre-back combinations. The regular pairing Gary Cahill John Stones (six matches). Cahill started 11 12 games. England's changing central defensive partnerships always survived relative comfort qualifiers picked apart heat tournament combat. Gary Cahill Phil Jagielka exposed Luis Suarez Edinson Cavani defeat Uruguay Brazil 2014, Chelsea's captain Chris Smalling fared better France two years later. Will different Russia? Southgate still shuffling position, pointers emerging might signpost way partnership next summer. Cahill Manchester United's rejuvenated Phil Jones started establish partnership. although glance towards Manchester City may offer even attractive option. John Stones disappeared almost unnoticed England's team heralded future defence following Â£47.5m move Everton Manchester City summer 2016. He showing sort form might tempt Southgate more. Neville says: ""If going major tournament six seven months' time John Stones number one centre-back fulfilling potential. ""In World Cup, John Stones got number one centre-back. That performs - produce qualities know got start number one centre-back probably alongside Phil Jones.""

Harry Kane Jermain Defoe responsible 31 So reasons England cheerful heading 2018 World Cup trauma recent major tournaments? The Kane-Alli axis carry England's threat, according Waddle. ""Kane seem miss. He right position every time can't coach that,"" says. ""You play Dele Alli him. Now look get best players build team around them. ""Alli cert. He plays Kane week week out. He makes lot goals great partnership."" England's World Cup wins 2014: None 2010: Slovenia (1-0) 2006: Paraguay (1-0), Trinidad & Tobago (2-0), Ecuador (1-0) 2002: Argentina (1-0), Denmark (3-0) 1998: Tunisia (2-0), Colombia (2-0) Phil Neville looks towards former home Old Trafford forward Southgate integrate alongside Kane Alli. ""Fast forward seven months got saying Rashford there"", says Neville. ""If Gareth find system Rashford Kane would exciting partnership teams could offer going forward. ""Kane level becoming world-class centre-forward Rashford got potential keeps developing. ""Rashford going superstar - I've said million times; I really believe that. You see him, Kane Dele Alli producing."" If Southgate use England's forthcoming friendlies forge link trio, squad carry serious danger Russia next summer. Should Kane England's World Cup captain? Outsiders - even England manager Fabio Capello - never understand nation's obsession leads team out. However, still matters seems Southgate narrowed choice Kane Henderson, auditions World Cup qualifiers. Harry Kane scored 11 goals England, including six past five appearances Kane captained team Slovakia. He advantage certain starter, goalscoring inspiration role model field, Henderson may need fight place. Neville certain be. He says: ""I've never fan centre-forwards captain - enough pressure score goals is. I would say Harry Kane, 'You concentrate scoring goals.' ""I'd give someone like Jordan Henderson, Eric Dier could real outside chance cements place team."" Butcher different view. ""There one person person going play regular basis Harry Kane,"" says. ""He poster boy also producing goods. ""He one first, first, name team sheet. You say Jordan Henderson. ""You can't argue Kane's record way goes work.

Certainly, many expected sleight hand Trump administration Deep State, evidence surfaced showing U.S. government simply shifted focus arming terrorists one agency another. Trump never ended Pentagon program, viewed much smaller initiative. However, documents recently revealed showing program officially set continue arena $2 billion next five years. Given secrecy program, however, many believe monetary value weapons shipments much higher. A new report released two international weapons monitoring groups, Organized Crime Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), confirmed Tuesday Pentagon continuing ship massive amounts weapons Syria. In addition, Department Defense attempting destroy paper trail. Both OCCRP BIRN provided conclusive evidence Pentagon shipping $2.2 billion worth weapons private weapons dealers terrorists Syria. They also provided evidence DOD altering paperwork end-user certificates order hide involvement. This story echoes early revelations made Bulgarian reporter Dilyana Gaytandzhieva reported use diplomatic flights cover weapons shipments anti-Syria coalition countries terrorists Syria, Yemen, locations. Gaytandzhieva subsequently interrogated fired job Trud. The OCCRP BIRN actually published number internal US Defense procurement files extensive investigation. These files showed Pentagon running major weapons trafficking pipeline reaches Balkans Caucuses ends Syria, Iraq, elsewhere. The program part â€œtrain equipâ€ program SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces), collection Arab Muslim terrorists fanatical Kurds mainly FSA (Free Syrian Army) YPG respectively. The mouthpiece Council Foreign Relations, Foreign Policy, covered issue well. FPâ€™s article states, The Department Defense budgeted $584 million specifically Syrian operation financial years 2017 2018, earmarked another $900 million spending Soviet-style munitions 2022. The total, $2.2 billion, likely understates flow weapons Syrian rebels coming years. . . . . . According report, many weapons suppliers â€” primarily Eastern Europe also former Soviet republics, including Kazakhstan, Georgia, Ukraine â€” links organized crime throughout Eastern Europe spotty business records. The sheer amount material necessary Pentagon program â€” one ammunition factory announced planned hire 1,000 new employees 2016 help cope demand â€” reportedly stretched suppliers limit, forcing Defense Department relax standards materials itâ€™s willing accept.. As Zero Hedge comments, It likely organized crime association reason Pentagon sought alter records. In addition, sheer volume weaponry continuing ship Syrian battlefield parts Middle East means inevitable proliferation among unsavory terror groups â€“ phenomenon already exhaustively documented connection reportedly closed CIA program topple Syrian government. The associations alliances among Arab former FSA groups DoD continues support north east remains fluid, means means US-supplied weapons continue pass among groups accountability end up. Seven documents published two international watchdog organizations show clear doctoring tampering DOD. In original documents, one see end user listed. After document tampered with, end user removed. The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) Ivan Angelovski, one authors watchdog report, told Foreign Policy that, â€œThe Pentagon removing evidence procurement records weapons actually going Syrian opposition.â€ Balkan Insight, website hosting report, states â€œSeven US procurement documents whitewashed remove reference â€˜Syriaâ€™ reporters contacted Pentagon enquire whether exporting countries â€“ Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Ukraine Georgia â€“ informed destination.â€ Foreign Policy, traditionally acted cheerleader operations undertaken destroy Syrian government, also stated U.S. policy â€œturbochargingâ€ â€œshadowy world Eastern European arms dealers.â€ While shocking, reports confirm information documented Gaytandzhieva fact United States continuing move ahead arming terrorists Syria, likely idea Balkanization Federalization mind future.

Iâ€™ve read believe deflect NFL ordeal nevertheless, past deep state moves mirrored prior justifying UN globalist legislation incrementally turn thumbscrews enslave us furtherâ€¦ My prayers go supposedly killed injured Las Vegas shooting, country many anti-Americans kneeling pampered protest, mass shooting observed veterans police officers standing up, assisting victims maneuvering directly shooter take out. Of course understand dead man tells tales. Real Americans donâ€™t kneel, stand get work save lives. Currently I give tremendous gratitude first responders helped save lives end violence. Despite fact news reporting shooting still early stages, five bizarre things donâ€™t add carnage. I run below. #1) Masses concert-goers reported presence multiple shooters Although law enforcement claims one shooter, multiple witnesses publicly reporting presence multiple shooters. This could reasonably response confusion chaos, itâ€™s also highly suspect shooter â€œfull autoâ€ weapon typically limited law enforcement military personnel. This question multiple shooters also raised Aurora, Colorado â€œBatman movie theaterâ€ shooting, countless witnesses reported presence multiple shooters. If shooting executed multiple shooters, would clearly suggest planning coordination among group individuals sought carry shooting political purpose kind. #2) Who informed concert-goers â€œall going dieâ€ full 45 minutes shooting began? Via UK Express: One woman, Route 91 music event, claimed unidentified woman told concert-goers â€œall going dieâ€ pushing way front venue. The witness, 21, told local news: â€œShe messing lady front telling going die, going die. â€œThey escorted make stop messing around people, none us knew going serious.â€ She described lady Hispanic. The lady escorted venue along man. The unnamed witness, attending event 21st birthday, described pair short, around 5 ft 5ins 5ft 6ins tall, looked like â€œeveryday peopleâ€. Itâ€™s obvious neither two individuals shooter, shooter much taller Caucasian dude. Therefore, â€œlone gunmanâ€ massacre. There coordination. At least three individuals mindful shooting take place. #3) The weapon pick videos FULL AUTO, almost improbable obtain legal means The multitude videos captured situation plainly reveal least one shooter running full auto weapons system. Such weapons almost unattainable â€œciviliansâ€ purchase. Although pre-1986 full auto weapons accessible sale, call extensive ATF documentation, background checks extremely long wait periods approaching one year. Additionally, tend cost $25,000 more, theyâ€™re incredibly rare. Full auto weapons, hand, commonly owned police officers, federal officials military organizations. It fascinating find weapon came exactly obtained. #4) Why exits obstructed, trapping suckers like rats maze? Countless reports witnesses scene disclose practically exits obstructed. One witness detailed scenario â€œbeing caught like rate mazeâ€ many â€œdead ends.â€ Why practically exits blocked? Basically, concert created kill zone amplified casualties. Until now, based Clark County Sheriff Vegas, 515 individuals injured 59 folks far died. These unspeakable numbers, drawing near war-time casualty counts. Itâ€™s apparent coverage shockingly high body count would likely folks free flee concert venue. Basically, concert trapped folks, preventing escaping, denying capacity seek cover. From there, continual, full-auto gunfire almost improbable survive. Furthermore, shooting began, stage lights aimed crowd, lighting audience making much easier target shooter(s). Was planned? #5) So shooter many 10 firearms room? Based news reports, shooter â€“ known Stephen Paddock â€“ many 10 firearms room, include several rifles. If sole shooter, whatâ€™s issue using many rifles? One dude clearly shoot one rifle, since possessed full auto rifle, could clearly accomplish evil aims concentrating one rifle. There demand numerous rifles. Hence rifles contributed room â€œstageâ€ crime scene large quantity guns? Why would one elderly man make effort carry 8 â€“ 10 weapons hotel room begin with? Thatâ€™s lot work. Rifles lightweight equipment. I get concept lone, elderly man would carry many rifles hotel room sensible reason tremendously suspect. It makes sense all. Got tip rumor?

Certainly, many expected sleight hand Trump administration Deep State, evidence surfaced showing U.S. government simply shifted focus arming terrorists one agency another. Trump never ended Pentagon program, viewed much smaller initiative. However, documents recently revealed showing program officially set continue arena $2 billion next five years. Given secrecy program, however, many believe monetary value weapons shipments much higher. A new report released two international weapons monitoring groups, Organized Crime Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), confirmed Tuesday Pentagon continuing ship massive amounts weapons Syria. In addition, Department Defense attempting destroy paper trail. Both OCCRP BIRN provided conclusive evidence Pentagon shipping $2.2 billion worth weapons private weapons dealers terrorists Syria. They also provided evidence DOD altering paperwork end-user certificates order hide involvement. This story echoes early revelations made Bulgarian reporter Dilyana Gaytandzhieva reported use diplomatic flights cover weapons shipments anti-Syria coalition countries terrorists Syria, Yemen, locations. Gaytandzhieva subsequently interrogated fired job Trud. The OCCRP BIRN actually published number internal US Defense procurement files extensive investigation. These files showed Pentagon running major weapons trafficking pipeline reaches Balkans Caucuses ends Syria, Iraq, elsewhere. The program part â€œtrain equipâ€ program SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces), collection Arab Muslim terrorists fanatical Kurds mainly FSA (Free Syrian Army) YPG respectively. The mouthpiece Council Foreign Relations, Foreign Policy, covered issue well. FPâ€™s article states, The Department Defense budgeted $584 million specifically Syrian operation financial years 2017 2018, earmarked another $900 million spending Soviet-style munitions 2022. The total, $2.2 billion, likely understates flow weapons Syrian rebels coming years. . . . . . According report, many weapons suppliers â€” primarily Eastern Europe also former Soviet republics, including Kazakhstan, Georgia, Ukraine â€” links organized crime throughout Eastern Europe spotty business records. The sheer amount material necessary Pentagon program â€” one ammunition factory announced planned hire 1,000 new employees 2016 help cope demand â€” reportedly stretched suppliers limit, forcing Defense Department relax standards materials itâ€™s willing accept.. As Zero Hedge comments, It likely organized crime association reason Pentagon sought alter records. In addition, sheer volume weaponry continuing ship Syrian battlefield parts Middle East means inevitable proliferation among unsavory terror groups â€“ phenomenon already exhaustively documented connection reportedly closed CIA program topple Syrian government. The associations alliances among Arab former FSA groups DoD continues support north east remains fluid, means means US-supplied weapons continue pass among groups accountability end up. Seven documents published two international watchdog organizations show clear doctoring tampering DOD. In original documents, one see end user listed. After document tampered with, end user removed.

As someone researches 3-D modeling, including assessing 3-D printed objects sure meet quality standards, Iâ€™m aware vulnerable methods storing malicious computer code physical world. Our groupâ€™s work laboratory, yet encountered malware hidden 3-D printing instructions encoded structure item scanned. But weâ€™re preparing possibility. At moment, itâ€™s likely us: An attacker would need specialized knowledge systemâ€™s functions succeed attacking it.

Transmitting infection In order device become infected compromised, nefarious party figure way get computer store process malware. The human keyboard common target. An attacker might send email telling user lottery going trouble responding work supervisor. In cases, virus designed unwittingly triggered routine software activities. Researchers University Washington tested another possibility recently, embedding computer virus DNA. The good news computers canâ€™t catch electronic virus bad software â€“ called malware â€“ embedded biological one. The DNA infection test concept attacking computer equipped read digital data stored DNA. Similarly, team scans 3-D printed object, storing processing data imagery collect. If attacker analyzed this, could â€“ perhaps â€“ identify step process would vulnerable compromised corrupted piece data. Then, would design object us scan would cause us receive data. Closer home, scan QR code, computer phone processes data code takes action â€“ perhaps sending email going specified URL. An attacker could find bug code-reader app allows certain precisely formatted text executed instead scanned processed. Or could something designed harm phone waiting target website. Imprecision protection The good news sensors less precision DNA sequencers. For instance, two mobile phone cameras pointed subject collect somewhat different information, based lighting, camera position closely itâ€™s zoomed in. Even small variations could render encoded malware inoperable, sensed data would always accurate enough translate working software. So itâ€™s unlikely personâ€™s phone would hacked taking photo something. But systems, like QR code readers, include methods correcting anomalies sensed data. And sensing environment highly controlled, like recent work assess 3-D printing, easier attacker affect sensor readings predictably. What perhaps problematic ability sensing provide gateway systems otherwise secure difficult attack. For example, prevent infection 3-D printing quality sensing system conventional attack, proposed placing another computer, one disconnected internet sources potential cyberattacks. But system still must scan 3-D printed object. A maliciously designed object could way attack otherwise disconnected system. Screening prevention Many software developers donâ€™t yet think potential hackers manipulate sensed data. But 2011, Iranian government hackers able capture U.S. spy drone way. Programmers computer administrators must ensure sensed data screened processing, handled securely, prevent unexpected hijacking. In addition developing secure software, another type system help: An intrusion detection system look common attacks, unusual behavior even things expected happen donâ€™t. Theyâ€™re perfect, course, times failing detect attacks others misidentifying legitimate activities attacks. Computer devices sense modify environment becoming common â€“ manufacturing robots, drones self-driving cars, among many examples. As happens, potential attacks include physical electronic elements grows significantly. Attackers may find attractive embed malicious software physical world, waiting unsuspecting people scan smartphone specialized device.
